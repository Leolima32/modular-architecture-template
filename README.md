Modular Architecture Template
================================

This project provides an example implementation of a modular architecture for building a RESTful API using .NET 6.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have .NET 6 and Microsoft SQL Server with a SQL Express instance installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of .NET from the official website ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)).

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Leolima32/modular-architecture-template.git
```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
$ cd modular-architecture-template\src\Api
```
3.  Start the development server:

```shell
$ dotnet run
```

The API will be running at ` https://localhost:7075`.

Modular Architecture
--------------------

This project follows a modular architecture, where each feature or component of the API is separated into its own module. This makes it easy to maintain, test, and scale the API as needed.
